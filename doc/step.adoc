=== Step Definition
A step definition is a single action executed for the test. There are two flavours of steps.
The step with the type 'normal'. This step will be instantiated for each test case.
The second flavour is 'single'. In this case there will only be one step instance
for all the test cases.

An example for a single step is a step which cleans the data base for the new run.
This must only be executed once for all the tests.

.Step
[source, js]
----
const step = {
  name: 'test suite 1',   <1>
  description: 'Desc 1',  <2>
	class: 'myClass'        <3>
}
----
<1> The name of this step. You can have the same step (class) with many different names.
<2> Any description for this step.
<3> The name under which the step is registered in the step registry.

Each element of the data array correspond to the test cases. This means that the first
data entry of an step is the data of the first test case. So you could not have
more data entries in a step than test cases. If this is a single step it is an
array with the data for all the test cases.
