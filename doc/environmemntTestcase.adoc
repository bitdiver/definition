== EnvironmemntTestcase
The test case environment is the context which lives for the whole execution of the test case.
For each test case an own environment will be created. This context is the right place to transport
data from one step to a following step in the test case.

The data is stored in a map.

{
  id: 'uuid'             <1>
  name: 'suite name'     <2>
  status: STATUS_OK      <3>
  description: 'a desc'  <4>

<1> The id is a uuid. It will be generated when the environment is created.

<3> The overall status of this run. If one test case has an error the complete run get the status error.
<4> Any description for this run.
<5> if a test case has failed the running status will be switched to false. So there will
    be no execution of further steps for this test case.
<6> This map is used to store the context information.
