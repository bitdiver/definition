== StepRegistry
This is the registry for all the step classes. The registry will be used
to create the real steps on runtime from the step definitions before.
The runner gets a stepDefinition which should be executed, then looks up
a implementation in the stepRegistry object.

So beforehand the steps needs to be registered in the step registry.
